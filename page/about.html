                    clean, spacious, and welcoming environment where students can enjoy healthy and affordable meals
                    during break and lunch times. Located conveniently near the main building, it offers a wide variety
                    of food and beverages, including local and international dishes, snacks, and drinks to suit
                    different tastes. Special options such as vegetarian meals and allergy-friendly choices are also

            <p> “Our school places a strong emphasis on the importance of health and fitness, which is why regular
                sports sessions are organized for all students. These sessions are carefully planned by teachers to
                encourage every student to take part in physical activities that improve their overall well-being.
                Through sports, students develop strength, stamina, flexibility, and coordination while also learning
                the value of teamwork, discipline, and fair play. Regular exercise helps reduce stress, boosts
                concentration, and enhances mental health, which in turn supports better academic performance. By
                participating in a variety of sports such as running, football, basketball, and other physical
                exercises, students not only maintain a healthy lifestyle but also gain skills that promote confidence
                and social interaction. These sports sessions reflect the school’s commitment to nurturing both the
                physical and mental growth of its students, preparing them for a balanced and healthy future.”</p>
