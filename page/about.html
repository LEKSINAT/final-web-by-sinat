                <p> <b>PNC school also gives food to students three times a day. </b>The canteen is an important
                    facility within the school, designed to provide students, teachers, and staff with a convenient and
                    comfortable place to enjoy meals and refreshments. It usually offers a wide variety of food and
                    beverage options, ranging from healthy local dishes to light snacks and drinks, ensuring that
                    everyone can find something to suit their tastes. In addition to being a food service area, the
                    canteen also acts as a social hub where students can relax, exchange ideas, and build friendships
                    during breaks. For schools that focus on IT or technology-related studies, the canteen often becomes
                    a lively space for students to discuss projects, share knowledge, and collaborate informally outside
                    the classroom. Many canteens also place a strong emphasis on cleanliness, hygiene, and eco-friendly
                    practices, such as waste segregation and reusable utensils, to promote a healthy and sustainable
                    environment for the entire school community.

        <div class="sport">
            <p> Our school places a strong emphasis on the importance of health and fitness, which is why regular
                sports sessions are organized for all students. These sessions are carefully planned by teachers to
                encourage every student to take part in physical activities that improve their overall well-being.
                Through sports, students develop strength, stamina, flexibility, and coordination while also learning
                the value of teamwork, discipline, and fair play. Regular exercise helps reduce stress, boosts
                concentration, and enhances mental health, which in turn supports better academic performance. By
                participating in a variety of sports such as running, football, basketball, and other physical
                exercises, students not only maintain a healthy lifestyle but also gain skills that promote confidence
                and social interaction. These sports sessions reflect the school’s commitment to nurturing both the
                physical and mental growth of its students, preparing them for a balanced and healthy future.</p>
