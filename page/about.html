                <p>Scholarships that teach about Information Technology (IT) are special programs designed to help
                    students gain IT skills without paying full tuition fees. These scholarships cover training in areas
                    such as programming, web development, networking, cybersecurity, and database management. Many
                    institutions around the world, including in Cambodia, provide IT-focused scholarships such as those
                    from TUX Global Institute, NTTI, ISTAD, and the Korea Software HRD Center. They often offer free or
                    discounted tuition, learning materials, and sometimes even monthly stipends. These programs are
                    aimed at students who show academic potential, have financial difficulties, or demonstrate a strong
                    interest in technology. By joining such scholarships, students can build solid IT skills, earn
                    internationally recognized certifications, and improve their chances of getting jobs in the growing
                    technology sector.</p>
